We leverage the discontinuity in the assignment mechanism of the Small and Medium Enterprise Instrument - the first European R&D subsidy targeting small firms - to provide the broadest quasi-experimental evidence on R&D grants over both geographical and sectoral scopes. Grants trigger sizable impacts on a wide range of firm-level outcomes. Heterogeneous effects are consistent with grants reducing financial frictions. This reduction is due to funding rather than certification. We also provide direct causal evidence on pure certification - signaling not attached to funding - and show that firms that only receive ‘quality stamps’ do not improve their performance. Finally, our estimates suggest that the scheme produces private returns that are positive and comparable to those of the US Small Business Innovation Research program, while also generating geographical and sectoral spillovers in the form of increased rates of entrepreneurial entry. </div>

The role of innovative start-ups in contributing to aggregate economic dynamism has attracted increased attention in recent years. While this has translated into several public policies explicitly targeting them, there is little evidence on their effectiveness. This article provides a comprehensive evaluation of the “Start-up Act,” a policy intervention aimed at supporting innovative start-ups in Italy. We construct a unique database encompassing detailed information on firm balance sheets, employment, firm demographics, patents and bank–firm relationships for all Italian start-ups. We use conditional difference-in-differences and instrumental variable strategies to evaluate the impact of the “Start-up Act” on firm performance. Results show that the policy induces a significant increase in several firm outcomes whereas no effect is detected in patenting propensity and survival chances. We also document that the policy alleviates financial frictions characterizing innovative start-ups through the provision of tax credits for equity and a public guarantee scheme which, respectively, trigger an increase in the probability of receiving VC and accessing bank credit. </div>

Financial constraints can severely limit the development of small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) and are very likely to affect innovative firms. In order to lower the barriers to firm growth, in 2014 the European Commission introduced the SME Instrument with the specific aim to support businesses with high-growth potential in need of external finance. By exploiting the availability of information not only on grant awards but also on applications, this is the first study that examines which types of firms apply to the scheme and which ones are selected for the two main rounds of funding. The evidence suggests that the scheme is successful at attracting SMEs with high-growth potential, and that – in line with signalling theory – patenting and prior venture capital funding are strong predictors of awards.</div>

This paper examines the uneven impact of the Great Recession on firm-level employment growth across firm size and age classes. Based on firm-level data from ten Eurozone countries, we show that, notwithstanding the negative impact of the crisis, young firms were the most dynamic group of firms and prime contributors to net job creation even during the recession. However, conditional on survival, young firms experienced a sharp drop in their employment growth rates, whereas small firms were mostly unaffected. By using industry-level measures of external financial dependence, we then show how financial frictions were a driver of the growth rates slowdown of young firms.</div>

Recent research has underscored the prominent role played by a small fraction of fast-growing new firms in contributing to aggregate net employment growth. While it is typically assumed that those firms experience this superior performance thanks to their ability in undertaking technological innovation, few empirical studies have explicitly addressed this issue. This article examines the innovation-employment nexus for startups using the Kauffman Firm Survey, a unique longitudinal dataset tracking a single cohort of US firms founded in 2004. Results based on fixed effects panel quantile regressions indicate an overall positive but heterogeneous effect of innovation activities on the conditional employment growth distribution. More in detail, the findings reveal that both research and development and patents have a positive association with employment growth especially for those new firms experiencing high growth.</div>
